![image](./images/COVER_Phantasmagoria.png)

*Phantasmagoria is a narrative driven RPG inspired by English folklore.*

Turn Based Combat - Classic turn based combat giving you time to plan your next strike.
Combat Interaction System - Follow button sequences to deal extra damage or defend and stack multipliers.
Deep dialogue systems - Think careful about how you respond to NPCs, it could be your only chance to obtain unique items.
Puzzle system - Uncover a variety of puzzles such as riddles with dynamic inputs.

This is a solo project. The intention is to build it out in chapters to gradually tell the story of the protangist **Oda** and her journey in discovering the secrets of the organisation she works for.
