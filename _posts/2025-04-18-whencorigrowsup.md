### Features:

**Dialogue Choices**  
Throughout the game, a few simple counters are used to decide the outcome of the story and which role Cori chooses.

These counters increment based on choices made throughout the game. On the final day, a comparison is made to choose the outcome. If there's no clear winner, a fail-safe default ending occurs.

A rare encounter with a counter karma system appears only if the player has not made any poor decisions throughout the story.
