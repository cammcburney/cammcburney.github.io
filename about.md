Hi! Since you made it here, I should share a little about me.

My name is Cameron McBurney and currently based in Manchester, I'm an aspiring games developer. My interests spread almost across the board when it comes to creativity, I am passionate about programming and relish in the challenge and the pace it offers. You'll often find me figuring out a new mechanic or developing old ones in my free time to find what makes them, and the player, tick!

I have a background in audio engineering and if I'm not working on scripts I'll be composing some new bits or designing an array of sounds. I dabble in the technological arts a little too when I need to give some life and feeling to my projects.
